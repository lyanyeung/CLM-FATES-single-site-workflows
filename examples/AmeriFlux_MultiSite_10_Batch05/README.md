# AmeriFlux MultiSite 10 — Batch 05

**Status (2026-10-25): Stage00 transfer workflow published; live Windows-to-IRIDIS transfer awaiting operator execution and a verified 10/10 log.**

Fifth independent ten-site AmeriFlux campaign, following [Batch04](../AmeriFlux_MultiSite_10_Batch04/). Current scope is transfer of original packages only. Raw data are not committed to GitHub.

Machine-readable source: [sites.tsv](sites.tsv). Names and years are supplied by the operator, not independently verified temporal coverage, cadence, QC or PFT classification. **US-UMB deliberately retains the distinct `FLUXNET_FULLSET_2007-2021_3-5` release name.** Its content/schema will be inspected separately after transfer. US-UiD and US-UMd remain distinct, with case preserved.

## Stage00 — run in LOCAL WSL

Windows source: `D:\Fluxes_Tower_Experiment\Ameriflux`; WSL mount: `/mnt/d/Fluxes_Tower_Experiment/Ameriflux`. Run the following in local WSL, not on IRIDIS or native PowerShell:

```bash
(
  set -euo pipefail
  RAW='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyanyeung/CLM-FATES-single-site-workflows/main'
  REL='examples/AmeriFlux_MultiSite_10_Batch05'
  BASE="$HOME/ameriflux_batch05_transfer"
  mkdir -p "$BASE/scripts/stage00"
  curl -fLsS --retry 3 "$RAW/$REL/sites.tsv" -o "$BASE/sites.tsv"
  SCRIPT="$BASE/scripts/stage00/00_upload_ameriflux_batch05.sh"
  curl -fLsS --retry 3 "$RAW/$REL/scripts/stage00/00_upload_ameriflux_batch05.sh" -o "$SCRIPT"
  bash -n "$SCRIPT"
  LOCAL_ROOT='/mnt/d/Fluxes_Tower_Experiment/Ameriflux' \
    bash "$SCRIPT" 2>&1 | tee "$BASE/upload_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"
)
```

Requires Bash, curl, ssh, rsync, sha256sum, find, awk, mktemp and head. [Transfer script](scripts/stage00/00_upload_ameriflux_batch05.sh) follows Batch04's implementation with only batch labels/socket prefix changed.

The full ten-site source preflight finishes before SSH connects. Each source must be an exact `<package>.zip` (case-insensitive match) or an exact same-named release directory. A ZIP takes priority if both are present. Missing or ambiguous sources stop execution; packages are never renamed or repacked.

One SSH master connection to `ly3n24@iridis6.soton.ac.uk` handles all transfers and checks. Authentication normally occurs once; a lost master stops the script rather than opening another password session. Logs remain in `$HOME/ameriflux_batch05_transfer/` on WSL. Rerun the same command to resume.

Remote layout:

```text
/iridisfs/scratch/ly3n24/CLM_FATES/sites/MY_EC_SITE/<SITE>/forcing/packages/<EXACT-PACKAGE>.zip
```

Same-named source directories go under `packages/<EXACT-PACKAGE>/`. Existing final destination files are preserved with `rsync --ignore-existing`; a different checksum is a hard stop, not permission to replace data. Interrupted uploads use rsync partial files. ZIPs receive local/remote SHA256 checks; directories receive recursive checksum comparison, including detection of unexpected remote files (`--delete` is dry-run only). Local originals are retained.

Only a complete run may print:

```text
UPLOAD VERIFIED: 10/10 (AmeriFlux Batch 05). Originals retained. No extraction or model jobs started.
```

Publication of these scripts is **not** evidence that transfer succeeded. Record actual sizes/checksums and operator output after the run. No extraction, forcing repair, DATM, surface generation or Slurm submission occurs in Stage00.
