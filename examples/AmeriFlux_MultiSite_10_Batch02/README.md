# AmeriFlux MultiSite 10 — Batch 02

Stage 00 prepares and uploads the ten exact releases in [sites.tsv](sites.tsv):
US-BZS, US-CMW, US-EML, US-GLE, US-Ha1, US-Ho1, US-Ho2, US-Ho3,
US-ICh and US-ICt. First-batch scripts and manifests are unchanged.

The release names and year labels are supplied by the operator. US-BZS and
US-Ho1 retain their original `FLUXNET_FULLSET` names and version suffixes.
These labels do not establish actual data coverage or internal CSV structure.

## Upload from the local WSL terminal

The source is `D:\Fluxes_Tower_Experiment\Ameriflux`, accessible from WSL as
`/mnt/d/Fluxes_Tower_Experiment/Ameriflux`. Each package must be a directly
contained `<package>.zip` (ZIP extension matching is case insensitive), or
a directly contained `<package>/` folder. ZIP takes priority if both exist.
No repacking is performed. Required commands include `bash`, `ssh`, `rsync`,
`sha256sum`, `find`, `awk` and `mktemp`.

Download directly from GitHub; no `git pull` is needed. Run in **LOCAL WSL**,
not in an IRIDIS SSH terminal:

```bash
(
  set -euo pipefail
  RAW='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyanyeung/CLM-FATES-single-site-workflows/ameriflux-batch02-transfer'
  BASE="$HOME/ameriflux_batch02_transfer"
  mkdir -p "$BASE/scripts/stage00"
  curl -fLsS --retry 3 "$RAW/examples/AmeriFlux_MultiSite_10_Batch02/sites.tsv" -o "$BASE/sites.tsv"
  curl -fLsS --retry 3 "$RAW/examples/AmeriFlux_MultiSite_10_Batch02/scripts/stage00/00_upload_ameriflux_batch02.sh" -o "$BASE/scripts/stage00/00_upload_ameriflux_batch02.sh"
  bash -n "$BASE/scripts/stage00/00_upload_ameriflux_batch02.sh"
  LOCAL_ROOT='/mnt/d/Fluxes_Tower_Experiment/Ameriflux' \
    bash "$BASE/scripts/stage00/00_upload_ameriflux_batch02.sh" \
    2>&1 | tee "$BASE/upload_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"
)
```

If the mounted directory actually uses the spelling `AmeriFlux`, change only
`LOCAL_ROOT` accordingly. Do not enter your password into a script or chat.

The script preflights all ten local sources before connecting. It opens one
SSH master to `ly3n24@iridis6.soton.ac.uk`; enter a password once at that
connection if requested. Host authenticity confirmation or an additional
factor may still be required by the SSH service. All subsequent commands
reuse the private socket in `/tmp`, use batch mode, and cannot fall back to
a new network connection. Keep the terminal and network connection open.
The master is closed automatically when the script exits.

Destination (same layout as Batch 01):

```text
/iridisfs/scratch/ly3n24/CLM_FATES/sites/MY_EC_SITE/<SITE>/forcing/packages/<PACKAGE>.zip
```

For a source folder, the destination ends in `packages/<PACKAGE>/` instead.
`REMOTE` and `REMOTE_ROOT` may be overridden if needed.

Existing files are preserved via `rsync --ignore-existing`; interrupted
transfers retain partial data for a later retry. Every ZIP is SHA256 checked;
source folders receive a recursive checksum dry-run that also detects extra
remote files. A same-named conflicting destination causes failure rather than
replacement. The script never deletes source or destination package files.
An interrupted run stops without asking for passwords repeatedly; rerun the
same command to reconnect once and resume. Previously verified files are
checked again. A checksum conflict needs inspection before another retry.

Completion is reported only by:

```text
UPLOAD VERIFIED: 10/10 (AmeriFlux Batch 02). Originals retained. No extraction or model jobs started.
```

This upload does not unpack releases or change any existing raw data,
US-Ha1 forcing, surfaces, cases or Slurm jobs. Next inspect package contents
before adapting extraction: FULLSET releases must not be assumed to contain
the same BIF/FLUXMET_HH files as the other eight releases. After extraction,
use the existing `forcing/raw/<PACKAGE>/` convention. No simulation period,
forcing cycle or spin-up duration has been chosen for this batch.

## Validation boundary

Validation passed: Bash syntax and six isolated integration checks with mock
SSH control and real local rsync/checksums: mixed ZIP/directory transfer,
identical rerun, missing source, conflicting ZIP, extra destination folder
file, and master disconnection. The mock checks one master launch and the
batch-only options on subsequent operations. Live SSH authentication and
multiplexing have not been tested here. No check authenticates to IRIDIS,
accesses the operator's D drive, or establishes a real upload.
